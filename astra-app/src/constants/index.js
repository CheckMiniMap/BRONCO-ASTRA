  p1: `We are Project Astra, a student-led Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) team at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. Our mission is to push the boundaries of autonomous aerial technology through innovation, collaboration, and hands-on engineering. We bring together students from diverse engineering disciplines to design, build, and test cutting-edge UAV systems capable of real-world applications.`,
  p2: `This year, we are developing a quadcopter to compete in the prestigious SUAS Competition in Maryland this June. Our UAV is designed for fully autonomous flight and navigation, integrating advanced object detection, precision payload deployment, and aerial mapping capabilities. The system will carry up to four payloads and deliver them with accuracy to designated targets, while also generating detailed image maps of the flight area to enhance mission awareness and performance.`,
  p3: `As a team, we are committed to pushing the limits of UAV technology through rigorous research, iterative design, and hands-on testing. With months of development, we refined our systems to meet the complex demands of the competition. Project Astra is more than just a competition teamâ€”we are a group of passionate engineers, problem solvers, and innovators striving to make an impact in the world of autonomous aviation.`
